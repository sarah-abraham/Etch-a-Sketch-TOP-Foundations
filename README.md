# Etch-A-Sketch - The Odin Project Foundations Course
The Etch-a-Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy where users create art by turning knobs. Here, a grid has been created where the color of a square on the grid changes when the mouse moves over it / hovers.
The grid size and the color to be displayed on hover can be changed.
